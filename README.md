# Loan Approval Prediction System

## Introduction
The *Loan Approval Prediction System* is a machine learning project that aims to automate the process of loan eligibility determination based on the applicant’s personal and financial information. This project leverages various machine learning algorithms to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected, assisting financial institutions in making informed decisions. It uses Python and popular libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and NumPy for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- *data/*: Contains the loan approval dataset used for training and testing the models.
- *notebooks/*: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- *src/*: Python scripts for data processing, model building, and prediction.
- *models/*: Stores the trained machine learning models.
- *README.md*: Documentation file with project details.
- *requirements.txt*: Lists the required Python libraries to run the project.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

Install all dependencies using the following command:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

- *Applicant Income*: The income of the loan applicant.
- *Coapplicant Income*: The income of the coapplicant, if any.
- *Loan Amount*: The total loan amount applied for.
- *Loan Amount Term*: The term of the loan in months.
- *Credit History*: Binary variable indicating whether the applicant has a good credit history.
- *Gender*: Gender of the applicant.
- *Marital Status*: Marital status of the applicant.
- *Dependents*: Number of dependents of the applicant.
- *Education*: Education level of the applicant.
- *Self-Employed*: Whether the applicant is self-employed.
- *Property Area*: The type of area in which the property is located (Urban, Semiurban, Rural).
- *Loan Status*: The target variable indicating if the loan is approved (Yes) or not (No).

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset undergoes several preprocessing steps to prepare it for model training:

1. *Handling Missing Values*: Missing values in features such as Loan Amount and Credit History are imputed with median values or mode.
2. *Encoding Categorical Variables*: Conversion of categorical variables into numerical form using label encoding or one-hot encoding.
3. *Feature Scaling*: Normalization of numerical features to bring them to a common scale, ensuring better model performance.

## Model Training
The following machine learning models are used for training and evaluation:

- *Logistic Regression*: A simple yet effective model for binary classification.
- *Decision Tree*: A model that makes decisions based on feature values, leading to a tree-like structure of decision rules.
- *Random Forest*: An ensemble of decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting.
- *Support Vector Machine (SVM)*: A model that finds the optimal hyperplane to classify the data points.

## Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- *Accuracy*: The proportion of correctly predicted instances among the total instances.
- *Precision*: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- *Recall*: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
- *F1 Score*: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, providing a balanced measure.

## How to Use
1. *Clone the Repository*:
    bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    
2. *Navigate to the Project Directory*:
    bash
    cd loan-approval-prediction
    
3. *Run the Jupyter Notebook*:
    Open notebooks/Loan_Approval_Prediction.ipynb to view the step-by-step implementation or use the Python scripts in the src/ directory for standalone predictions.

4. *Predict Loan Approval*:
    Use the src/predict.py script to input applicant details and predict loan approval:
    bash
    python src/predict.py --applicant_income 5000 --coapplicant_income 2000 --loan_amount 150 --loan_term 360 --credit_history 1 --gender Male --married Yes --dependents 1 --education Graduate --self_employed No --property_area Urban
    

## Results
The models provide the following results on the test dataset:

- *Logistic Regression*: 80% accuracy
- *Decision Tree*: 78% accuracy
- *Random Forest*: 82% accuracy
- *SVM*: 79% accuracy

These results indicate that the system is effective for predicting loan approvals, although further model tuning and feature engineering could improve performance.

## Future Enhancements
- *Feature Engineering*: Incorporate additional features such as employment history or asset details to improve prediction accuracy.
- *Web Interface*: Develop a web-based application for easier input of applicant details and real-time predictions.
- *Model Deployment*: Deploy the model as a REST API for integration with other financial applications.
